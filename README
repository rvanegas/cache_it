cache_it
========

Cache for ActiveRecord objects, backed by ActiveSupport::CacheStore of your choice.  Cache-money was 
not yet ported to Rails 3 so I rolled my own.


Example
=======

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  cache_it do |c|
    c.index :first, :last
    c.index :email
  end
end

user = User.cache_it_find :first => "Joe", :last => "Schmoe"
user = User.cache_it_find :email => "joe@example.com"
user.age = 30
user.cache_it_write
